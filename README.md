# What is pixel sorting?
Pixel Sorting is a digital art effect where we apply a sorting algorithm to the pixels of an image and sort them based on certain criteria to create stunning results

### GIF animation methods:
`Animate with random offset` and `Animate with threshold` are the two methods that can be used to animate the glitch effect

- `Animate with random offset` : The offset will be randomly generated for each frame
- `Animate with threshold` : The threshold will slowly be incremented until it reaches the value set by the user

---

#### How does the mask work and the threshold work ?<br>

The mask is a black and white image that will be used to determine which pixels will be sorted and which won't. The threshold is a value between 0 and 255 that will be used to determine which pixels will be sorted and which won't. The pixels that have a value that falles inside both thresholds will be sorted and the ones that don't won't be sorted.
