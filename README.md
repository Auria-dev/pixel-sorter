# What is pixel sorting?
Pixel Sorting is a digital art effect where we apply a sorting algorithm to the pixels of an image and sort them based on certain criteria to create stunning results

# Is it hard?
Pixel sorting can be complicated, but 
You can try this right now on [my website](https://nitaki-dev.github.io/pixel-sorter/)!

# How do I use it?
My pixel sort has a few interesting options:<br><br>

Sorting direction, this allows you to choose if you want to sort horizontally or vertically<br>
Sorting mode, choose HOW the pixels get sorted, either by RGB, Red, Green, Blue, Saturation, Luminence, or my personal favorite Hue<br><br>

Masking, this is very useful if you want the image to keep a certain consistency. (you can visualize the mask using the display option)<br>
For the masking option you can choose the threshold, this gives you more control on the mask<br><br>

Finally you have efects, Color Quantization or Dithering.<br><br>
-Dithering reduces the colors used and applies a noise to give the illusion of having more colors (this may seem useless but it looks cool)<br>
-Color Quantization simply reduces the color pallet and keeps it that way, this gives a sharper look to the image.<br>
