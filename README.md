# What is pixel sorting?
Pixel Sorting is a digital art effect where we apply a sorting algorithm to the pixels of an image and sort them based on certain criteria to create stunning results

# FAQ:

> What is the difference between the sorting algorithms ?<br>

- **RGB** : Sorts the pixels based on their RGB values
- **Red** : Sorts the pixels based on their Red values
- **Green** : Sorts the pixels based on their Green values
- **Blue** : Sorts the pixels based on their Blue values
- **Saturation** : Sorts the pixels based on their Saturation values
- **Luminance** : Sorts the pixels based on their Luminance values
- **Hue** : Sorts the pixels based on their Hue values

> How does the mask work and the threshold work ?<br>

The mask is a black and white image that will be used to determine which pixels will be sorted and which won't. The threshold is a value between 0 and 255 that will be used to determine which pixels will be sorted and which won't. The pixels that have a value that falles inside both thresholds will be sorted and the ones that don't won't be sorted.

> What is Color Quantization ? <br>

Color quantization is the process of reducing the number of colors used in an image while trying to maintain the visual appearance of the original image (use a smaller colorpalette)

<br>

> What is Dithering ?<br>

Dithering is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images (smoothen the color transitions)
